The training archive contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats. Train your algorithm on these files and predict the labels
(1 = dog, 0 = cat).

The file Cat_vs_dogs_classification.h5 has been zipped and compressed into 4 files Cat_vs_dogs_classification.7z. This file needs to be unpacked and contains the previously conducted training to train AI in recognizing photos. The file should be placed in the main folder of Google Drive and works for the Colab project Cat_and_Dog_Trained.ipynb.

The "history" file contains the previously conducted training and is used to display graphs in the Cat_and_Dog_Trained.ipynb project. This file should be placed in the main folder of Google Drive.
